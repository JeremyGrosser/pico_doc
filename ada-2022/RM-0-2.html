<A NAME="I1002"></A>The AARM contains all of the text in the consolidated 
Ada Reference Manual, plus various annotations. It is intended primarily 
for compiler writers, validation test writers, and others who wish to 
study the fine details. The annotations include detailed rationale for 
individual rules and explanations of some of the more arcane interactions 
among the rules.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="WideAbove"><SPAN Class="swiss"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 156%"><B>Design 
Goals</B></SPAN></SPAN></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p6">6/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Ada was originally designed with three overriding 
concerns: program reliability and maintenance, programming as a human 
activity, and efficiency. The 1995 revision to the language was designed 
to provide greater flexibility and extensibility, additional control 
over storage management and synchronization, and standardized packages 
oriented toward supporting important application areas, while at the 
same time retaining the original emphasis on reliability, maintainability, 
and efficiency. Subsequent editions, including this fourth edition, have 
provided further flexibility and added more standardized packages within 
the framework provided by the 1995 revision.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p7">7</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The need for languages that promote reliability and 
simplify maintenance is well established. Hence emphasis was placed on 
program readability over ease of writing. For example, the rules of the 
language require that program variables be explicitly declared and that 
their type be specified. Since the type of a variable is invariant, compilers 
can ensure that operations on variables are compatible with the properties 
intended for objects of the type. Furthermore, error-prone notations 
have been avoided, and the syntax of the language avoids the use of encoded 
forms in favor of more English-like constructs. Finally, the language 
offers support for separate compilation of program units in a way that 
facilitates program development and maintenance, and which provides the 
same degree of checking between units as within a unit.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p8">8</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Concern for the human programmer was also stressed 
during the design. Above all, an attempt was made to keep to a relatively 
small number of underlying concepts integrated in a consistent and systematic 
way while continuing to avoid the pitfalls of excessive involution. The 
design especially aims to provide language constructs that correspond 
intuitively to the normal expectations of users.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p9">9</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Like many other human activities, the development 
of programs is becoming ever more decentralized and distributed. Consequently, 
the ability to assemble a program from independently produced software 
components continues to be a central idea in the design. The concepts 
of packages, of private types, and of generic units are directly related 
to this idea, which has ramifications in many other aspects of the language. 
An allied concern is the maintenance of programs to match changing requirements; 
type extension and the hierarchical library enable a program to be modified 
while minimizing disturbance to existing tested and trusted components.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p10">10/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">No language can avoid the problem of efficiency. 
Languages that require over-elaborate compilers, or that lead to the 
inefficient use of storage or execution time, force these inefficiencies 
on all machines and on all programs. Every construct of the language 
was examined in the light of present implementation techniques. Any proposed 
construct whose implementation was unclear or that required excessive 
machine resources was rejected. Parallel constructs were introduced to 
simplify making safe and efficient use of modern multicore architectures.</div>
<div class="WideAbove"><SPAN Class="swiss"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 156%"><B>Language 
Summary</B></SPAN></SPAN></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p11">11/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">An Ada program is composed of one or more program 
units. Program units can be subprograms (which define executable algorithms), 
packages (which define collections of entities), task units (which define 
concurrent computations), protected units (which define operations for 
the coordinated sharing of data between tasks), or generic units (which 
define parameterized forms of packages and subprograms). Each program 
unit normally consists of two parts: a specification, containing the 
information that is visible to other units, and a body, containing the 
implementation details, which are not visible to other units. Most program 
units can be compiled separately.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p12">12</a></div>
<div class="Normal">This distinction of the specification and body, and 
the ability to compile units separately, allows a program to be designed, 
written, and tested as a set of largely independent software components.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p13">13/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">An Ada program will normally make use of a library 
of program units of general utility. The language provides means whereby 
individual organizations can construct their own libraries. All libraries 
are structured in a hierarchical manner; this enables the logical decomposition 
of a subsystem into individual components. The text of a separately compiled 
program unit names the library units it requires.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p14">14</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><I>Program Units</I></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p15">15/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">A subprogram is the basic unit for expressing an 
algorithm. There are two kinds of subprograms: procedures and functions. 
A procedure is the means of invoking a series of actions. For example, 
it can read data, update variables, or produce some output. It can have 
parameters, to provide a controlled means of passing information between 
the procedure and the point of call. A function is the means of invoking 
the computation of a value. It is similar to a procedure, but in addition 
will return a result.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p16">16</a></div>
<div class="Normal">A package is the basic unit for defining a collection 
of logically related entities. For example, a package can be used to 
define a set of type declarations and associated operations. Portions 
of a package can be hidden from the user, thus allowing access only to 
the logical properties expressed by the package specification.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p17">17/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Subprogram and package units can be compiled separately 
and arranged in hierarchies of parent and child units giving fine control 
over visibility of the logical properties and their detailed implementation.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p18">18/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">A task unit is the basic unit for defining a task 
whose sequence of actions can be executed concurrently with those of 
other tasks. Such tasks can be implemented on multicomputers, multiprocessors, 
or with interleaved execution on a single processor. A task unit can 
define either a single executing task or a task type permitting the creation 
of any number of similar tasks.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p19">19/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">A protected unit is the basic unit for defining protected 
operations for the coordinated use of data shared between tasks. Simple 
mutual exclusion is provided automatically, and more elaborate sharing 
protocols can be defined. A protected operation can either be a subprogram 
or an entry. A protected entry specifies a Boolean expression (an entry 
barrier) that blocks the execution of the body until it evaluates to 
True. A protected unit can define a single protected object or a protected 
type permitting the creation of several similar objects.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p20">20</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><I>Declarations and Statements</I></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p21">21</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The body of a program unit generally contains two 
parts: a declarative part, which defines the logical entities to be used 
in the program unit, and a sequence of statements, which defines the 
execution of the program unit.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p22">22/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The declarative part associates names with declared 
entities. For example, a name can denote a type, a constant, a variable, 
or an exception. A declarative part also introduces the names and parameters 
of other nested subprograms, packages, task units, protected units, and 
generic units to be used in the program unit.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p23">23</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The sequence of statements describes a sequence of 
actions that are to be performed. The statements are executed in succession 
(unless a transfer of control causes execution to continue from another 
place).</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p24">24</a></div>
<div class="Normal">An assignment statement changes the value of a variable. 
A procedure call invokes execution of a procedure after associating any 
actual parameters provided at the call with the corresponding formal 
parameters.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p25">25</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Case statements and if statements allow the selection 
of an enclosed sequence of statements based on the value of an expression 
or on the value of a condition.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p26">26/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The loop statement provides the basic iterative mechanism 
in the language. A loop statement specifies a sequence of statements 
that are executed repeatedly as directed by an iteration scheme, or until 
an exit statement is encountered.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p27">27</a></div>
<div class="Normal">A block statement comprises a sequence of statements 
preceded by the declaration of local entities used by the statements.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p28">28/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Certain statements are associated with concurrent 
execution. A delay statement delays the execution of a task for a specified 
duration or until a specified time. An entry call statement is written 
as a procedure call statement; it requests an operation on a task or 
on a protected object, blocking the caller until the operation can be 
performed. A called task can accept an entry call by executing a corresponding 
accept statement, which specifies the actions then to be performed as 
part of the rendezvous with the calling task. An entry call on a protected 
object is processed when the corresponding entry barrier evaluates to 
true, whereupon the body of the entry is executed. The requeue statement 
permits the provision of a service as a number of related activities 
with preference control. One form of the select statement allows a selective 
wait for one of several alternative rendezvous. Other forms of the select 
statement allow conditional or timed entry calls and the asynchronous 
transfer of control in response to some triggering event. Various parallel 
constructs, including parallel loops and parallel blocks, support the 
initiation of multiple logical threads of control designed to execute 
in parallel when multiple processors are available.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p29">29/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Execution of a program unit can encounter error situations 
in which normal program execution cannot continue. For example, an arithmetic 
computation can exceed the maximum allowed value of a number, or an attempt 
can be made to access an array component by using an incorrect index 
value. To deal with such error situations, the statements of a program 
unit can be textually followed by exception handlers that specify the 
actions to be taken when the error situation arises. Exceptions can be 
raised explicitly by a raise statement.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p30">30</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><I>Data Types</I></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p31">31/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Every object in the language has a type, which characterizes 
a set of values and a set of applicable operations. The main categories 
of types are elementary types (comprising enumeration, numeric, and access 
types) and composite types (including array and record types).</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p32">32/2</a></div>
<div class="Normal">An enumeration type defines an ordered set of distinct 
enumeration literals, for example a list of states or an alphabet of 
characters. The enumeration types Boolean, Character, Wide_Character, 
and Wide_Wide_Character are predefined.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p33">33</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Numeric types provide a means of performing exact 
or approximate numerical computations. Exact computations use integer 
types, which denote sets of consecutive integers. Approximate computations 
use either fixed point types, with absolute bounds on the error, or floating 
point types, with relative bounds on the error. The numeric types Integer, 
Float, and Duration are predefined.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p34">34/2</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Composite types allow definitions of structured objects 
with related components. The composite types in the language include 
arrays and records. An array is an object with indexed components of 
the same type. A record is an object with named components of possibly 
different types. Task and protected types are also forms of composite 
types. The array types String, Wide_String, and Wide_Wide_String are 
predefined.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p35">35/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Record, task, and protected types can have special 
components called discriminants which parameterize the type. Variant 
record structures that depend on the values of discriminants can be defined 
within a record type.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p36">36/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Access types allow the construction of linked data 
structures. A value of an access type represents a reference to an object 
declared as aliased or to an object created by the evaluation of an allocator. 
Several variables of an access type can designate the same object, and 
components of one object can designate the same or other objects. Both 
the elements in such linked data structures and their relation to other 
elements can be altered during program execution. Access types also permit 
references to subprograms to be stored, passed as parameters, and ultimately 
dereferenced as part of an indirect call.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p37">37</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Private types permit restricted views of a type. 
A private type can be defined in a package so that only the logically 
necessary properties are made visible to the users of the type. The full 
structural details that are externally irrelevant are then only available 
within the package and any child units.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p38">38/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">From any type a new type can be defined by derivation. 
A type, together with its derivatives (both direct and indirect) form 
a derivation class. Class-wide operations can be defined that accept 
as a parameter an operand of any type in a derivation class. For record 
and private types, the derivatives can be extensions of the parent type. 
Types that support these object-oriented capabilities of class-wide operations 
and type extension are tagged, so that the specific type of an operand 
within a derivation class can be identified at run time. When an operation 
of a tagged type is applied to an operand whose specific type is not 
known until run time, implicit dispatching is performed based on the 
tag of the operand.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p38.1">38.1/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Interface types provide abstract models from which 
other interfaces and types can be composed and derived. This provides 
a reliable form of multiple inheritance. Interface types can also be 
implemented by task types and protected types thereby enabling concurrent 
programming and inheritance to be merged.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p39">39</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The concept of a type is further refined by the concept 
of a subtype, whereby a user can constrain the set of allowed values 
of a type. Subtypes can be used to define subranges of scalar types, 
arrays with a limited set of index values, and records and private types 
with particular discriminant values.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p40">40</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><I>Other Facilities</I></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p41">41/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Aspect clauses can be used to specify the mapping 
between types and features of an underlying machine. For example, the 
user can specify that objects of a given type are to be represented with 
a given number of bits, or that the components of a record are to be 
represented using a given storage layout. Other features allow the controlled 
use of low level, nonportable, or implementation-dependent aspects, including 
the direct insertion of machine code.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p41.1">41.1/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspect clauses can also be used to specify more 
abstract properties of program entities, such as the pre- and postconditions 
of a subprogram, or the invariant for a private type. Additional aspects 
are specifiable to allow user-defined types to use constructs of the 
language, such as literals, aggregates, or indexing, normally reserved 
for particular language-defined categories of types, such as numeric 
types, record types, or array types.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p42">42/2</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The predefined environment of the language provides 
for input-output and other capabilities by means of standard library 
packages. Input-output is supported for values of user-defined as well 
as of predefined types. Standard means of representing values in display 
form are also provided.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p42.1">42.1/2</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The predefined standard library packages provide 
facilities such as string manipulation, containers of various kinds (vectors, 
lists, maps, etc.), mathematical functions, random number generation, 
and access to the execution environment.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p42.2">42.2/2</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The specialized annexes define further predefined 
library packages and facilities with emphasis on areas such as real-time 
scheduling, interrupt handling, distributed systems, numerical computation, 
and high-integrity systems.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p43">43</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Finally, the language provides a powerful means of 
parameterization of program units, called generic program units. The 
generic parameters can be types and subprograms (as well as objects and 
packages) and so allow general algorithms and data structures to be defined 
that are applicable to all types of a given class.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada is the result of a collective effort to design 
a common language for programming large scale and real-time systems.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.2">65.2/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The common high order language program began in 
1974. The requirements of the United States Department of Defense were 
formalized in a series of documents which were extensively reviewed by 
the Services, industrial organizations, universities, and foreign military 
departments. The Ada language was designed in accordance with the final 
(1978) form of these requirements, embodied in the Steelman specification.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.3">65.3/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ada design team was led by Jean D. Ichbiah 
and has included Bernd Krieg-Brueckner, Brian A. Wichmann, Henry F. Ledgard, 
Jean-Claude Heliard, Jean-Loup Gailly, Jean-Raymond Abrial, John G.P. 
Barnes, Mike Woodger, Olivier Roubine, Paul N. Hilfinger, and Robert 
Firth.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.4">65.4/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;At various stages of the project, several people 
closely associated with the design team made major contributions. They 
include J.B. Goodenough, R.F. Brender, M.W. Davis, G. Ferran, K. Lester, 
L. MacLaren, E. Morel, I.R. Nassi, I.C. Pyle, S.A. Schuman, and S.C. 
Vestal.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.5">65.5/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Two parallel efforts that were started in the second 
phase of this design had a deep influence on the language. One was the 
development of a formal definition using denotational semantics, with 
the participation of V. Donzeau-Gouge, G. Kahn, and B. Lang. The other 
was the design of a test translator with the participation of K. Ripken, 
P. Boullier, P. Cadiou, J. Holden, J.F. Hueras, R.G. Lange, and D.T. 
Cornhill. The entire effort benefitted from the dedicated assistance 
of Lyn Churchill and Marion Myers, and the effective technical support 
of B. Gravem, W.L. Heimerdinger, and P. Cleve. H.G. Schmitz served as 
program manager.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.6">65.6/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the five years spent on this project, several 
intense week-long design reviews were conducted, with the participation 
of P. Belmont, B. Brosgol, P. Cohen, R. Dewar, A. Evans, G. Fisher, H. 
Harte, A.L. Hisgen, P. Knueven, M. Kronental, N. Lomuto, E. Ploedereder, 
G. Seegmueller, V. Stenning, D. Taffs, and also F. Belz, R. Converse, 
K. Correll, A.N. Habermann, J. Sammet, S. Squires, J. Teller, P. Wegner, 
and P.R. Wetherall.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.7">65.7/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Several persons had a constructive influence with 
their comments, criticisms and suggestions. They include P. Brinch Hansen, 
G. Goos, C.A.R. Hoare, Mark Rain, W.A. Wulf, and also E. Boebert, P. 
Bonnard, H. Clausen, M. Cox, G. Dismukes, R. Eachus, T. Froggatt, H. 
Ganzinger, C. Hewitt, S. Kamin, R. Kotler, O. Lecarme, J.A.N. Lee, J.L. 
Mansion, F. Minel, T. Phinney, J. Roehrich, V. Schneider, A. Singer, 
D. Slosberg, I.C. Wand, the reviewers of Ada-Europe, AdaTech, Afcet, 
those of the LMSC review team, and those of the Ada Tokyo Study Group.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.8">65.8/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;These reviews and comments, the numerous evaluation 
reports received at the end of the first and second phase, the nine hundred 
language issue reports and test and evaluation reports received from 
fifteen different countries during the third phase of the project, the 
thousands of comments received during the ANSI Canvass, and the on-going 
work of the IFIP Working Group 2.4 on system implementation languages 
and that of the Purdue Europe LTPL-E committee, all had a substantial 
influence on the final definition of Ada.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.9">65.9/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Military Departments and Agencies have provided 
a broad base of support including funding, extensive reviews, and countless 
individual contributions by the members of the High Order Language Working 
Group and other interested personnel. In particular, William A. Whitaker 
provided leadership for the program during the formative stages. David 
A. Fisher was responsible for the successful development and refinement 
of the language requirement documents that led to the Steelman specification.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.10">65.10/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ada 83 language definition was developed by 
Cii Honeywell Bull and later Alsys, and by Honeywell Systems and Research 
Center, under contract to the United States Department of Defense. William 
E. Carlson and later Larry E. Druffel served as the technical representatives 
of the United States Government and effectively coordinated the efforts 
of all participants in the Ada program.</div>
