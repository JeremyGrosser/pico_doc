part of the standard.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p15.c">15.c</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">Note also that we only require &ldquo;<I>an 
appropriate</I> sequence of external interactions&rdquo; rather than 
&ldquo;<I>the same</I> sequence...&rdquo; An optimizer may cause a different 
sequence of external interactions to be produced than would be produced 
without the optimizer, so long as the new sequence still satisfies the 
requirements of the standard. For example, optimization might affect 
the relative rate of progress of two concurrent tasks, thereby altering 
the order in which two external interactions occur.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p15.d">15.d/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">Note that the Ada 83 RM explicitly mentions 
the case of an &ldquo;exact effect&rdquo; of a program, but since so 
few programs have their effects defined that exactly, we don't even mention 
this &ldquo;special&rdquo; case. In particular, almost any program that 
uses floating point or tasking has to have some level of inexactness 
in the specification of its effects. And if one includes aspects of the 
timing of the external interactions in the external effect of the program 
(as is appropriate for a real-time language), no &ldquo;exact effect&rdquo; 
can be specified. For example, if two external interactions initiated 
by a single task are separated by a &ldquo;<B>delay</B> 1.0;&rdquo; then 
the language rules imply that the two external interactions have to be 
separated in time by at least one second, as defined by the clock associated 
with the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-9-6.html#S0268">delay_relative_statement</A></SPAN>. 
This in turn implies that the time at which an external interaction occurs 
is part of the characterization of the external interaction, at least 
in some cases, again making the specification of the required &ldquo;exact 
effect&rdquo; impractical.&nbsp;</div>

An implementation conforming to this Reference Manual may provide additional 
aspects, attributes, library units, and pragmas. However, it shall not 
provide any aspect, attribute, library unit, or pragma having the same 
name as an aspect, attribute, library unit, or pragma (respectively) 
specified in a Specialized Needs Annex unless the provided construct 
is either as specified in the Specialized Needs Annex or is more limited 
in capability than that required by the Annex. A program that attempts 
to use an unsupported capability of an Annex shall either be identified 
by the implementation before run time or shall raise an exception at 
run time.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p17.a">17.a</a></div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>The last sentence of the 
preceding paragraph defines what an implementation is allowed to do when 
it does not &quot;conform&quot; to a Specialized Needs Annex. In particular, 
the sentence forbids implementations from providing a construct with 
the same name as a corresponding construct in a Specialized Needs Annex 
but with a different syntax (e.g., an extended syntax) or quite different 
semantics. The phrase concerning &quot;more limited in capability&quot; 
is intended to give permission to provide a partial implementation, such 
as not implementing a subprogram in a package or having a restriction 
not permitted by an implementation that conforms to the Annex. For example, 
a partial implementation of the package Ada.Decimal might have Decimal.Max_Decimal_Digits 
as 15 (rather than the required 18). This allows a partial implementation 
to grow to a fully conforming implementation.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p17.b">17.b</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">A restricted implementation might be restricted 
by not providing some subprograms specified in one of the packages defined 
by an Annex. In this case, a program that tries to use the missing subprogram 
will usually fail to compile. Alternatively, the implementation might 
declare the subprogram as abstract, so it cannot be called. Alternatively, 
a subprogram body might be implemented just to raise Program_Error. The 
advantage of this approach is that a program to be run under a fully 
conforming Annex implementation can be checked syntactically and semantically 
under an implementation that only partially supports the Annex. Finally, 
an implementation might provide a package declaration without the corresponding 
body, so that programs can be compiled, but partitions cannot be built 
and executed.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p17.c">17.c</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">To ensure against wrong answers being delivered 
by a partial implementation, implementers are required to raise an exception 
when a program attempts to use an unsupported capability and this can 
be detected only at run time. For example, a partial implementation of 
Ada.Decimal might require the length of the Currency string to be 1, 
and hence, an exception would be raised if a subprogram were called in 
the package Edited_Output with a length greater than 1.&nbsp;</div>
