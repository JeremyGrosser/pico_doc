When a formal function is used to provide an ordering for a container,

<span class="insert5">Given a &quot;&lt;&quot; operator that provides

If a container's element type is controlled, the point at which the element

Requirements below). For the &quot;normal&quot; containers, we</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;We</span> 
do not specify precisely where this will happen (it will happen no later

<span class="delete5">This is not likely to be a hardship, as the element 
type has to be nonlimited. Types used to manage scarce resources generally 
need to be limited. Otherwise, the amount of resources needed is hard

order of adjusts/finalizations. For common uses of nonlimited controlled 
types such as managing storage, the types already have to manage arbitrary 
copies.</span></div>

to define precisely what is and is not allowed behavior.&nbsp;</div>

When this clause says that the behavior of something is unspecified<A NAME="I8229"></A>, 
we really mean that any result of executing Ada code short of erroneous 
execution is allowed. We do not mean that memory not belonging to the 
parameters of the operation can be trashed. When we mean to allow erroneous 
behavior, we specifically say that execution is erroneous. All this means 
<span class="insert5">that,&nbsp;</span>if the containers are written in Ada<span class="insert5">,</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;is that</span> checks should not be suppressed or removed assuming some 
behavior of other code, and that the implementation should take care 
to avoid creating internal dangling accesses by assuming behavior from 
generic formals that can't be guaranteed. We don't try to say this normatively 
because it would be fairly complex, and implementers are unlikely to 
increase their support costs by fielding implementations that are unstable 
if given buggy hash functions, et al.&nbsp;</div>

iterator allowed blocking, it would be illegal inside of a parallel construct

of unsynchronized global objects, it would be illegal when the default 
conflict checking policy is in effect (see <A HREF="AA-9-10-1.html">9.10.1</A>). 
These requirements include sequential iterators; the iterator does not

to declare suitable aspects. The specific type of a container iterator 
is declared by the implementation and is not part of the visible specification 
(iterator functions just return a value of a class-wide type). The iterator 
interface itself cannot impose such a requirement since it needs to be 
able to work with user-defined types that do need to allow blocking. 
We give this as a global requirement to avoid duplication.</span>&nbsp;</div>
