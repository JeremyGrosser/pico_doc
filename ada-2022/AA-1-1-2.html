<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>The idea of the Specialized 
Needs Annexes is that implementations can choose to target certain application 
areas. For example, an implementation specifically targeted to embedded 
machines might support the application-specific features for Real-time 
Systems, but not the application-specific features for Information Systems.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p23.b">23.b</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">The Specialized Needs Annexes extend the core 
language only in ways that users, implementations, and standards bodies 
are allowed to extend the language; for example, via additional library 
units, attributes, representation items (see <A HREF="AA-13-1.html">13.1</A>), 
<SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-2-8.html#S0019">pragma</A></SPAN>s, and 
constraints on semantic details that are left unspecified by the core 
language. Many implementations already provide much of the functionality 
defined by Specialized Needs Annexes; our goal is to increase uniformity 
among implementations by defining standard ways of providing the functionality.</div>

We recommend that the certification procedures allow implementations 
to certify the core language, plus any set of the Specialized Needs Annexes. 
We recommend that implementations <I>not</I> be allowed to certify a 
portion of one of the Specialized Needs Annexes, although implementations 
can, of course, provide uncertified support for such portions. We have 
designed the Specialized Needs Annexes assuming that this recommendation 
is followed. Thus, our decisions about what to include and what not to 
include in those annexes are based on the assumption that each annex 
is certified in an &ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo; manner.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p23.d">23.d</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">An implementation may, of course, support extensions 
that are different from (but possibly related to) those defined by one 
of the Specialized Needs Annexes. We recommend that, where appropriate, 
implementations do this by adding library units that are children of 
existing language-defined library packages.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p23.e">23.e</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">An implementation should not provide extensions 
that conflict with those defined in the Specialized Needs Annexes, in 
the following sense: Suppose an implementation supports a certain error-free 
program that uses only functionality defined in the core and in the Specialized 
Needs Annexes. The implementation should ensure that that program will 
still be error free in some possible full implementation of all of the 
Specialized Needs Annexes, and that the semantics of the program will 
not change. For example, an implementation should not provide a package 
with the same name as one defined in one of the Specialized Needs Annexes, 
but that behaves differently, <I>even if that implementation does not 
claim conformance to that Annex</I>.</div>

this is where we put statements like so-and-so is equivalent to such-and-such. 
(We ought to try to really mean it when we say such things!) Similarly,
