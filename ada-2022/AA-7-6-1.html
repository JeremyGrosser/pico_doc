<div class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>We need to finalize subcomponents

<div class="Annotations"><B>To be honest:&nbsp;</B>Formally, completion and

In <A HREF="AA-3-10-2.html">3.10.2</A> we assign an accessibility level 
to the result of an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-3.html#S0106">aggregate</A></SPAN> 
or function call that is used to directly initialize a part of an object 
based on the object being initialized. This is important to ensure that 
any access discriminants denote objects that live at least as long as 
the object being initialized. However, if the result of the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-3.html#S0106">aggregate</A></SPAN> 
or function call is not built directly in the target object, but instead 
is built in an anonymous object that is then assigned to the target, 
the anonymous object needs to be finalized after the assignment rather 
than persisting until the target object is finalized (but not its coextensions). 
(Note than an implementation is never required to create such an anonymous 
object, and in some cases is required to <I>not</I> have such a separate 
object, but rather to build the result directly in the target.)</div>

The special case for explicitly aliased parameters of functions is needed 
for the same reason, as access discriminants of the returned object may 
designate one of these parameters. In that case, we want to lengthen 
the lifetime of the anonymous objects as long as the possible lifetime 
of the result.</div>

We don't do a similar change for other kinds of calls, because the extended 
lifetime of the parameters adds no value, but could constitute a storage 
leak. For instance, such an anonymous object created by a procedure call 
in the elaboration part of a package body would have to live until the 
end of the program, even though it could not be used after the procedure 
returns (other than via Unchecked_Access).&nbsp;</div>

Note that the lifetime of the master given to anonymous objects in explicitly 
aliased parameters of functions is not necessarily as long as the lifetime 
of the master of the object being initialized (if the function call is 
used to initialize an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-8.html#S0164">allocator</A></SPAN>, 
for instance). In that case, the accessibility check on explicitly aliased 
parameters will necessarily fail if any such anonymous objects exist. 
This is necessary to avoid requiring the objects to live as long as the 
access type or having the implementation complexity of an implicit coextension.

<B>Corrigendum:</B> Stated that if Adjust raises an exception during

2005 to include all kinds of assignment other than <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-5-2.html#S0173">assignment_statement</A></SPAN>s.</div>

Revised the definition of master to include <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-4.html#S0132">expression</A></SPAN>s 
and <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-5-1.html#S0167">statement</A></SPAN>s, 
in order to cleanly define what happens for tasks and controlled objects 
created as part of a subprogram call. Having done that, all of the special 
wording to cover those cases is eliminated (at least until the Ada comments 
start rolling in).</div>

We define <I>finalization of the collection</I> here, so as to be able 
to conveniently refer to it in other rules (especially in <A HREF="AA-4-8.html">4.8</A>, 
&ldquo;<A HREF="AA-4-8.html">Allocators</A>&rdquo;).</div>

Clarified that a coextension is finalized at the same time as the outer 
object. (This was intended for Ada 95, but since the concept did not 
have a name, it was overlooked.)&nbsp;</div>

<A NAME="I4640"></A><B>Correction:</B> Better defined when objects allocated 
from anonymous access types are finalized. This could be inconsistent 
if objects are finalized in a different order than in an Ada 2005 implementation 
and that order caused different program behavior; however programs that 
depend on the order of finalization within a single master are already 
fragile and hopefully are rare.&nbsp;</div>

are passed as explicitly aliased parameters (see <A HREF="AA-6-1.html">6.1</A>) 
of functions. The model for these parameters is explained in detail in 
<A HREF="AA-6-4-1.html">6.4.1</A>.&nbsp;</div>
