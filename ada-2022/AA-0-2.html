Ada was originally designed with three overriding concerns: program reliability 
and maintenance, programming as a human activity, and efficiency. The 
1995 revision to the language was designed to provide greater flexibility 
and extensibility, additional control over storage management and synchronization, 
and standardized packages oriented toward supporting important application 
areas, while at the same time retaining the original emphasis on reliability, 
maintainability, and efficiency. <span class="insert5">Subsequent editions, 
including this</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;This</span> <span class="insert5">fourth</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;third</span> 
edition<span class="insert5">, have provided</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;provides</span> 
further flexibility and <span class="insert5">added</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;adds</span> 
more standardized packages within the framework provided by the 1995 
revision.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p7">7</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The need for languages that promote reliability and 
simplify maintenance is well established. Hence emphasis was placed on 
program readability over ease of writing. For example, the rules of the 
language require that program variables be explicitly declared and that 
their type be specified. Since the type of a variable is invariant, compilers 
can ensure that operations on variables are compatible with the properties 
intended for objects of the type. Furthermore, error-prone notations 
have been avoided, and the syntax of the language avoids the use of encoded 
forms in favor of more English-like constructs. Finally, the language 
offers support for separate compilation of program units in a way that 
facilitates program development and maintenance, and which provides the 
same degree of checking between units as within a unit.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p8">8</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Concern for the human programmer was also stressed 
during the design. Above all, an attempt was made to keep to a relatively 
small number of underlying concepts integrated in a consistent and systematic 
way while continuing to avoid the pitfalls of excessive involution. The 
design especially aims to provide language constructs that correspond 
intuitively to the normal expectations of users.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p9">9</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Like many other human activities, the development 
of programs is becoming ever more decentralized and distributed. Consequently, 
the ability to assemble a program from independently produced software 
components continues to be a central idea in the design. The concepts 
of packages, of private types, and of generic units are directly related 
to this idea, which has ramifications in many other aspects of the language. 
An allied concern is the maintenance of programs to match changing requirements; 
type extension and the hierarchical library enable a program to be modified 
while minimizing disturbance to existing tested and trusted components.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p10">10/5</a></div>

No language can avoid the problem of efficiency. Languages that require 
over-elaborate compilers, or that lead to the inefficient use of storage 
or execution time, force these inefficiencies on all machines and on 
all programs. Every construct of the language was examined in the light 
of present implementation techniques. Any proposed construct whose implementation 
was unclear or that required excessive machine resources was rejected.<span class="insert5">&nbsp;Parallel constructs were introduced to simplify making safe and efficient 
use of modern multicore architectures.</span></div>

An Ada program is composed of one or more program units. Program units 
<span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> be 
subprograms (which define executable algorithms), packages (which define 
collections of entities), task units (which define concurrent computations), 
protected units (which define operations for the coordinated sharing 
of data between tasks), or generic units (which define parameterized 
forms of packages and subprograms). Each program unit normally consists 
of two parts: a specification, containing the information that <span class="insert5">is</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;must 
be</span> visible to other units, and a body, containing the implementation 
details, which <span class="insert5">are</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;need</span> 
not <span class="delete5">be&nbsp;</span>visible to other units. Most program 
units can be compiled separately.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p12">12</a></div>
<div class="Normal">This distinction of the specification and body, and 
the ability to compile units separately, allows a program to be designed, 
written, and tested as a set of largely independent software components.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p13">13/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI12s/AI12-0446-1.TXT">AI12-0446-1</A></I>} 
An Ada program will normally make use of a library of program units of 
general utility. The language provides means whereby individual organizations 
can construct their own libraries. All libraries are structured in a 
hierarchical manner; this enables the logical decomposition of a subsystem 
into individual components. The text of a separately compiled program 
unit <span class="insert5">names</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;must name</span> 
the library units it requires.</div>

A subprogram is the basic unit for expressing an algorithm. There are 
two kinds of subprograms: procedures and functions. A procedure is the 
means of invoking a series of actions. For example, it <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
read data, update variables, or produce some output. It <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
have parameters, to provide a controlled means of passing information 
between the procedure and the point of call. A function is the means 
of invoking the computation of a value. It is similar to a procedure, 
but in addition will return a result.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p16">16</a></div>
<div class="Normal">A package is the basic unit for defining a collection 
of logically related entities. For example, a package can be used to 
define a set of type declarations and associated operations. Portions 
of a package can be hidden from the user, thus allowing access only to 
the logical properties expressed by the package specification.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p17">17/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI12s/AI12-0441-1.TXT">AI12-0441-1</A></I>} 
Subprogram and package units <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
be compiled separately and arranged in hierarchies of parent and child 
units giving fine control over visibility of the logical properties and 
their detailed implementation.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p18">18/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI12s/AI12-0441-1.TXT">AI12-0441-1</A></I>} 
A task unit is the basic unit for defining a task whose sequence of actions 
<span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> be 
executed concurrently with those of other tasks. Such tasks <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
be implemented on multicomputers, multiprocessors, or with interleaved 
execution on a single processor. A task unit <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
define either a single executing task or a task type permitting the creation 
of any number of similar tasks.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p19">19/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AIs/AI-00114.TXT">AI95-00114-01</A></I>}

A protected unit is the basic unit for defining protected operations 
for the coordinated use of data shared between tasks. Simple mutual exclusion 
is provided automatically, and more elaborate sharing protocols can be 
defined. A protected operation can either be a subprogram or an entry. 
A protected entry specifies a Boolean expression (an entry barrier) that 
<span class="insert5">blocks the execution of the body until it evaluates 
to True</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;must be True before the body of 
the entry is executed</span>. A protected unit <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
define a single protected object or a protected type permitting the creation 
of several similar objects.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p20">20</a></div>
<div class="Normal"><I>Declarations and Statements</I></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p21">21</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The body of a program unit generally contains two 
parts: a declarative part, which defines the logical entities to be used 
in the program unit, and a sequence of statements, which defines the 
execution of the program unit.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p22">22/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI12s/AI12-0441-1.TXT">AI12-0441-1</A></I>} 
The declarative part associates names with declared entities. For example, 
a name <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
denote a type, a constant, a variable, or an exception. A declarative 
part also introduces the names and parameters of other nested subprograms, 
packages, task units, protected units, and generic units to be used in 
the program unit.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p23">23</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The sequence of statements describes a sequence of 
actions that are to be performed. The statements are executed in succession 
(unless a transfer of control causes execution to continue from another 
place).</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p24">24</a></div>
<div class="Normal">An assignment statement changes the value of a variable. 
A procedure call invokes execution of a procedure after associating any 
actual parameters provided at the call with the corresponding formal 
parameters.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p25">25</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Case statements and if statements allow the selection 
of an enclosed sequence of statements based on the value of an expression 
or on the value of a condition.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p26">26/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI12s/AI12-0446-1.TXT">AI12-0446-1</A></I>} 
The loop statement provides the basic iterative mechanism in the language. 
A loop statement specifies <span class="delete5">that&nbsp;</span>a sequence 
of statements <span class="insert5">that are</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;is 
to be</span> executed repeatedly as directed by an iteration scheme, 
or until an exit statement is encountered.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p27">27</a></div>
<div class="Normal">A block statement comprises a sequence of statements 
preceded by the declaration of local entities used by the statements.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p28">28/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI12s/AI12-0119-1.TXT">AI12-0119-1</A></I>} 
Certain statements are associated with concurrent execution. A delay 
statement delays the execution of a task for a specified duration or 
until a specified time. An entry call statement is written as a procedure 
call statement; it requests an operation on a task or on a protected 
object, blocking the caller until the operation can be performed. A called 
task <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
accept an entry call by executing a corresponding accept statement, which 
specifies the actions then to be performed as part of the rendezvous 
with the calling task. An entry call on a protected object is processed 
when the corresponding entry barrier evaluates to true, whereupon the 
body of the entry is executed. The requeue statement permits the provision 
of a service as a number of related activities with preference control. 
One form of the select statement allows a selective wait for one of several 
alternative rendezvous. Other forms of the select statement allow conditional 
or timed entry calls and the asynchronous transfer of control in response 
to some triggering event.<span class="insert5">&nbsp;Various parallel constructs, 
including parallel loops and parallel blocks, support the initiation 
of multiple logical threads of control designed to execute in parallel 
when multiple processors are available.</span></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p29">29/5</a></div>
<div class="Normal">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI12s/AI12-0441-1.TXT">AI12-0441-1</A></I>} 
Execution of a program unit <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
encounter error situations in which normal program execution cannot continue. 
For example, an arithmetic computation <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
exceed the maximum allowed value of a number, or an attempt <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
be made to access an array component by using an incorrect index value. 
To deal with such error situations, the statements of a program unit 
can be textually followed by exception handlers that specify the actions 
to be taken when the error situation arises. Exceptions can be raised 
explicitly by a raise statement.</div>

Every object in the language has a type, which characterizes a set of 
values and a set of applicable operations. The main <span class="insert5">categories</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;classes</span> 
of types are elementary types (comprising enumeration, numeric, and access 
types) and composite types (including array and record types).</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p32">32/2</a></div>

An enumeration type defines an ordered set of distinct enumeration literals, 
for example a list of states or an alphabet of characters. The enumeration 
types Boolean, Character, Wide_Character, and Wide_Wide_Character are 
predefined.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p33">33</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Numeric types provide a means of performing exact 
or approximate numerical computations. Exact computations use integer 
types, which denote sets of consecutive integers. Approximate computations 
use either fixed point types, with absolute bounds on the error, or floating 
point types, with relative bounds on the error. The numeric types Integer, 
Float, and Duration are predefined.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p34">34/2</a></div>

Composite types allow definitions of structured objects with related 
components. The composite types in the language include arrays and records. 
An array is an object with indexed components of the same type. A record 
is an object with named components of possibly different types. Task 
and protected types are also forms of composite types. The array types 
String, Wide_String, and Wide_Wide_String are predefined.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p35">35/5</a></div>

Record, task, and protected types <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
have special components called discriminants which parameterize the type. 
Variant record structures that depend on the values of discriminants 
can be defined within a record type.</div>

Access types allow the construction of linked data structures. A value 
of an access type represents a reference to an object declared as aliased 
or to an object created by the evaluation of an allocator. Several variables 
of an access type <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
designate the same object, and components of one object <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
designate the same or other objects. Both the elements in such linked 
data structures and their relation to other elements can be altered during 
program execution. Access types also permit references to subprograms 
to be stored, passed as parameters, and ultimately dereferenced as part 
of an indirect call.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p37">37</a></div>
<div class="Normal">Private types permit restricted views of a type. 
A private type can be defined in a package so that only the logically 
necessary properties are made visible to the users of the type. The full 
structural details that are externally irrelevant are then only available 
within the package and any child units.</div>

From any type a new type <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
be defined by derivation. A type, together with its derivatives (both 
direct and indirect) form a derivation class. Class-wide operations <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
be defined that accept as a parameter an operand of any type in a derivation 
class. For record and private types, the derivatives <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
be extensions of the parent type. Types that support these object-oriented 
capabilities of class-wide operations and type extension <span class="insert5">are</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;must 
be</span> tagged, so that the specific type of an operand within a derivation 
class can be identified at run time. When an operation of a tagged type 
is applied to an operand whose specific type is not known until run time, 
implicit dispatching is performed based on the tag of the operand.</div>

Interface types provide abstract models from which other interfaces and 
types <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
be composed and derived. This provides a reliable form of multiple inheritance. 
Interface types <span class="insert5">can</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;may</span> 
also be implemented by task types and protected types thereby enabling 
concurrent programming and inheritance to be merged.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p39">39</a></div>
<div class="Normal">The concept of a type is further refined by the concept 
of a subtype, whereby a user can constrain the set of allowed values 
of a type. Subtypes can be used to define subranges of scalar types, 
arrays with a limited set of index values, and records and private types 
with particular discriminant values.</div>

Aspect clauses can be used to specify the mapping between types and features 
of an underlying machine. For example, the user can specify that objects 
of a given type <span class="insert5">are to</span><span class="delete5">&nbsp;must</span> 
be represented with a given number of bits, or that the components of 
a record are to be represented using a given storage layout. Other features

aspects, including the direct insertion of machine code.</div>

<span class="insert5">Aspect clauses can also be used to specify more 
abstract properties of program entities, such as the pre- and postconditions 
of a subprogram, or the invariant for a private type. Additional aspects 
are specifiable to allow user-defined types to use constructs of the 
language, such as literals, aggregates, or indexing, normally reserved 
for particular language-defined categories of types, such as numeric 
types, record types, or array types.</span></div>

<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.1">65.1/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada is the result of a collective effort to design 
a common language for programming large scale and real-time systems.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.2">65.2/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The common high order language program began in 
1974. The requirements of the United States Department of Defense were 
formalized in a series of documents which were extensively reviewed by 
the Services, industrial organizations, universities, and foreign military 
departments. The Ada language was designed in accordance with the final 
(1978) form of these requirements, embodied in the Steelman specification.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.3">65.3/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ada design team was led by Jean D. Ichbiah 
and has included Bernd Krieg-Brueckner, Brian A. Wichmann, Henry F. Ledgard, 
Jean-Claude Heliard, Jean-Loup Gailly, Jean-Raymond Abrial, John G.P. 
Barnes, Mike Woodger, Olivier Roubine, Paul N. Hilfinger, and Robert 
Firth.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.4">65.4/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;At various stages of the project, several people 
closely associated with the design team made major contributions. They 
include J.B. Goodenough, R.F. Brender, M.W. Davis, G. Ferran, K. Lester, 
L. MacLaren, E. Morel, I.R. Nassi, I.C. Pyle, S.A. Schuman, and S.C. 
Vestal.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.5">65.5/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Two parallel efforts that were started in the second 
phase of this design had a deep influence on the language. One was the 
development of a formal definition using denotational semantics, with 
the participation of V. Donzeau-Gouge, G. Kahn, and B. Lang. The other 
was the design of a test translator with the participation of K. Ripken, 
P. Boullier, P. Cadiou, J. Holden, J.F. Hueras, R.G. Lange, and D.T. 
Cornhill. The entire effort benefitted from the dedicated assistance 
of Lyn Churchill and Marion Myers, and the effective technical support 
of B. Gravem, W.L. Heimerdinger, and P. Cleve. H.G. Schmitz served as 
program manager.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.6">65.6/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the five years spent on this project, several 
intense week-long design reviews were conducted, with the participation 
of P. Belmont, B. Brosgol, P. Cohen, R. Dewar, A. Evans, G. Fisher, H. 
Harte, A.L. Hisgen, P. Knueven, M. Kronental, N. Lomuto, E. Ploedereder, 
G. Seegmueller, V. Stenning, D. Taffs, and also F. Belz, R. Converse, 
K. Correll, A.N. Habermann, J. Sammet, S. Squires, J. Teller, P. Wegner, 
and P.R. Wetherall.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.7">65.7/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Several persons had a constructive influence with 
their comments, criticisms and suggestions. They include P. Brinch Hansen, 
G. Goos, C.A.R. Hoare, Mark Rain, W.A. Wulf, and also E. Boebert, P. 
Bonnard, H. Clausen, M. Cox, G. Dismukes, R. Eachus, T. Froggatt, H. 
Ganzinger, C. Hewitt, S. Kamin, R. Kotler, O. Lecarme, J.A.N. Lee, J.L. 
Mansion, F. Minel, T. Phinney, J. Roehrich, V. Schneider, A. Singer, 
D. Slosberg, I.C. Wand, the reviewers of Ada-Europe, AdaTech, Afcet, 
those of the LMSC review team, and those of the Ada Tokyo Study Group.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.8">65.8/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;These reviews and comments, the numerous evaluation 
reports received at the end of the first and second phase, the nine hundred 
language issue reports and test and evaluation reports received from 
fifteen different countries during the third phase of the project, the 
thousands of comments received during the ANSI Canvass, and the on-going 
work of the IFIP Working Group 2.4 on system implementation languages 
and that of the Purdue Europe LTPL-E committee, all had a substantial 
influence on the final definition of Ada.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.9">65.9/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Military Departments and Agencies have provided 
a broad base of support including funding, extensive reviews, and countless 
individual contributions by the members of the High Order Language Working 
Group and other interested personnel. In particular, William A. Whitaker 
provided leadership for the program during the formative stages. David 
A. Fisher was responsible for the successful development and refinement 
of the language requirement documents that led to the Steelman specification.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p65.10">65.10/3</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ada 83 language definition was developed by 
Cii Honeywell Bull and later Alsys, and by Honeywell Systems and Research 
Center, under contract to the United States Department of Defense. William 
E. Carlson and later Larry E. Druffel served as the technical representatives 
of the United States Government and effectively coordinated the efforts 
of all participants in the Ada program.</div>

versions also use color to indicate the version of the change. Where 
paragraphs are inserted, the paragraph numbers are of the form pp.nn, 
where pp is the number of the preceding paragraph, and nn is an insertion 
number. For instance, the first paragraph inserted after paragraph 8 
is numbered 8.1, the second paragraph inserted is numbered 8.2, and so 
on. Deleted paragraphs are indicated by text such as <I></I><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 80%"><I>This 
paragraph was deleted.</I></SPAN><I></I> Deleted paragraphs include empty 
paragraphs that were numbered in the 1995 edition of the Ada Reference 
Manual. Similar markings and numbering are used for changes to annotations.
