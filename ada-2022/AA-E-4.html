<I>remote subprogram call</I> is a subprogram call that invokes the execution

The partition that originates the remote subprogram call is the <I>calling 
partition</I>, and the partition that executes the corresponding subprogram 
body is the <I>called partition</I>. Some remote procedure calls are 
allowed to return prior to the completion of subprogram execution. These 
are called <I>asynchronous remote procedure calls</I>.</div>

between partitions]. This action is called <I>marshalling</I>. <I>Unmarshalling</I> 
is the reverse action of reconstructing the parameters or results from 
the stream-oriented representation. [Marshalling is performed initially 
as part of the remote subprogram call in the calling partition; unmarshalling 
is done in the called partition. After the remote subprogram completes, 
marshalling is performed in the called partition, and finally unmarshalling

This check makes certain that the specific type passed or returned in 
an RPC satisfies the rules for a &quot;communicable&quot; type. Normally 
this is guaranteed by the compile-time restrictions on remote call interfaces. 
However, with class-wide types, it is possible to pass an object whose 
tag identifies a type declared outside the &quot;safe&quot; packages.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p18.b">18.b</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">This is considered an accessibility_check since 
only the types declared in &quot;safe&quot; packages are considered truly 
&quot;global&quot; (cross-partition). Other types are local to a single 
partition. This is analogous to the &quot;accessibility&quot; of global 
vs. local declarations in a single-partition program.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p18.c">18.c</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">This rule replaces a rule from an early version 
of Ada 9X which was given in the subclause on Remote Types Library Units 
(now <A HREF="AA-E-2-2.html">E.2.2</A>, &ldquo;<A HREF="AA-E-2-2.html">Remote 
Types Library Units</A>&rdquo;). That rule tried to prevent &quot;bad&quot; 
types from being sent by arranging for their tags to mismatch between 
partitions. However, that interfered with other uses of tags. The new 
rule allows tags to agree in all partitions, even for those types which 
are not &quot;safe&quot; to pass in an RPC.&nbsp;</div>

conform to the PCS interface as defined by the specification of the language-defined 
package System.RPC (see <A HREF="AA-E-5.html">E.5</A>). The calling stub

in which case Do_APC shall be used. On the receiving side, the corresponding 
receiving stub shall be invoked by the RPC-receiver.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p20.a">20.a</a></div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Implementation Note:&nbsp;</B>One possible implementation 
model is as follows:</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p20.b">20.b</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">The code for calls to subprograms declared in 
an RCI package is generated normally, that is, the call-site is the same

bodies is also generated normally. Subprogram's prologue and epilogue 
are the same as for a local call.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p20.c">20.c</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">When compiling the specification of an RCI package, 
the compiler generates calling stubs for each visible subprogram. Similarly, 
when compiling the body of an RCI package, the compiler generates receiving 
stubs for each visible subprogram together with the appropriate tables 
to allow the RPC-receiver to locate the correct receiving stub.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p20.d">20.d</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">For the statically bound remote calls, the identity

<div class="SmallBulleted">It allocates (or reuses) a stream of Params_Stream_Type

It calls Do_RPC unless an aspect Asynchronous is specified as True for 
the procedure in which case it calls Do_APC. An access value designating 
the message stream allocated and initialized above is passed as the Params

If the aspect Asynchronous is not specified for the procedure, Do_RPC 
blocks until a reply message arrives, and then returns to the calling 
stub. The stub returns after extracting from the Result stream, using 
Read operations, the <B>in out</B> and <B>out</B> parameters or the function 
result. If the reply message indicates that the execution of the remote 
subprogram propagated an exception, the exception is propagated from 
Do_RPC to the calling stub, and thence to the point of the original remote 
subprogram call. If Do_RPC detects that communication with the remote 
partition has failed, it propagates Communication_Error.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p20.j">20.j</a></div>
<div class="Annotations" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">On the receiving

<div class="SmallBulleted">The receiving stub calls the actual subprogram 
body and, upon completion of the subprogram, uses Write to insert the 
results into the stream pointed to by the Result parameter. The receiving 
stub returns to the RPC-receiver procedure which in turn returns to the 
PCS. If the actual subprogram body propagates an exception, it is propagated 
by the RPC-receiver to the PCS, which handles the exception, and indicates 
in the reply message that the execution of the subprogram body propagated 
an exception. The exception occurrence can be represented in the reply 
message using the Write attribute of Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Occurrence.

Do_APC: The partition ID of all controlling operands are checked for 
equality (a Constraint_Error is raised if this check fails). The partition 
ID value is used for the Partition parameter. An index into the <I>tagged-type-descriptor</I> 
is created. This index points to the receiving stub of the class-wide 
operation. This index and the index to the table (described above) are 
written to the stream. Then, the actual parameters are marshalled into 
the message stream. For a controlling operand, only the access value 
designating the remote object is required (the other two components are 
already present in the other parameters).</div>

<div class="Annotations">On the called partition (after the RPC-receiver 
has transferred control to the appropriate receiving stub) the parameters 
are first unmarshalled. Then, the tags of the controlling operands (obtained 
by dereferencing the pointer to the object) are checked for equality. 
<A NAME="I10237"></A>If the check fails Constraint_Error is raised and 
propagated back to the calling partition, unless it is a result of an 
asynchronous call. Finally, a dispatching call to the specific subprogram 
(based on the controlling object's tag) is made. Note that since this 
subprogram is not in an RCI package, no specific stub is generated for 
it, it is called normally from the <I>dispatching stub</I>.</div>

With respect to shared variables in shared passive library units, the 
execution of the corresponding subprogram body of a synchronous remote 
procedure call is considered to be part of the execution of the calling 
task. The execution of the corresponding subprogram body of an asynchronous 
remote procedure call proceeds in parallel with the calling task and 
does not signal the next action of the calling task (see <A HREF="AA-9-10.html">9.10</A>).

<div class="Notes">NOTE 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A given active partition can 
both make and receive remote subprogram calls. Thus, an active partition 
can act as both a client and a server.</div>

<div class="Notes">NOTE 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a given exception is propagated 
by a remote subprogram call, but the exception does not exist in the 
calling partition, the exception can be handled by an <B>others</B> choice 
or be propagated to and handled by a third partition.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>This situation can happen 
in a case of dynamically nested remote subprogram calls, where an intermediate 
call executes in a partition that does not include the library unit that 
defines the exception.&nbsp;</div>
