== For each crate that contains changes

* [ ] Increment version in alire.toml and commit
* [ ] Create a signed git tag for the new version
* [ ] Push master and tags to github
* [ ] alr publish

== Add the new release to alire-index

* [ ] Update your alire-index checkout to match the upstream stable-1.1 branch
* [ ] Copy alire/releases/${CRATE_NAME}-${CRATE_VERSION}.toml to the alire-index checkout
* [ ] Commit, review, and push the alire-index diff, open a pull request to merge.
